    /*Data Structures
    IQ: List vs Set

    List > Ordered and Indexed Collection, May contain duplicates

    Set > Collection of Unique values, not ordered, no indexing

    IQ: What types of Collections/Data structures you have used?

    Depending on the data that I am working with, I use Arrays, Lists, Sets, Maps.


      IQ: Difference between Array vs ArrayList?

    Arrays are fixed size
    ArrayList's size auotomatically adjusted

    Arrays can hold primitives and object
    ArrayList can hold only objects

    Arrays can be multi dimensional
    ArrayList cannot be multi-dimentional

    Array is a build in data structure
    ArrayList is implementing class of List interface in Collection framework

       IQ: what is the difference ArrayList vs LinkedList?

    ArrayList is array based, internally uses array
    LinkedList consists of nodes/values that are related to each other

    ArrayList and LinkedList both keep ordering
    ArrayList and LinkedList both allow duplicates

    Q: Difference between ArrayList vs Vector?

    ArrayList is not thread safe/syncronized
    Vector is thread safe/syncronized

    ArrayList is faster than Vector

    Both allow duplicate values and keep ordering

    Both are implementations of List interface

    How do you sort an arraylist?

   Collections.sort(coll); -> helps sort an arraylist.

    IQ: Do you use data structures in your current automation project?

    Yes, I am very comfortable with data manipulations using Arrays, Collections framework, maps etc. I choose my data structure based on my data and requirements.

            IQ: Difference between HashMap and HashTable?

            1) HashTable is thread-safe/synchronized
    HashMap is not thread safe and faster

2) HashTable does not allow any null key
    HashMap allows one null key

3) Both of them implement Map interface.
